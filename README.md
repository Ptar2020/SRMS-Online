Hello.
If you're reading this, it means you've reached the README.md to another of my projects as a programmer.
It is one of the projects that I built as I was getting to know about Python/Django/HTML/CSS/Javascript.
I thought, and was advised, that the best way to learn is by doing.
So, I decided to practice that.
Since my profession was a high school teacher, and was always doing exams analysis for my students, I decided to make a system to help in doing this.
So, I tried to emulate the system that I was using at school.
I did so much and during this period I learnt alot.
Thought he system may not work perfectly, I believe it achieved it's purpose in me.

This is a <b>Django</b> project on the backend, <b>HTML, CSS and Javascript</b> on the frontend
